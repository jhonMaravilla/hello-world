I am Jhon Jherick Maravila. I am in Software Development and Network Engineering program at Sheridan College.
I enjoy coding because it gives me this weird excitement and frustration at the same time whenever I encounter problem in my assignments
or projects. I look forward to our Angular class. I'm pretty sure this class will be awesome.
